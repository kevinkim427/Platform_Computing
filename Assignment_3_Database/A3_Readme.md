# Metric Tracker with Database

This is the ReadMe for Assignment 3 Database for CSE4500 Platform Computing course. We use the metric tracker code from assignment 2 and synch those values to a database of our choice. I used mongoDB, I had to wrtie to a csv file and then upload the data on the csv file to the database.
